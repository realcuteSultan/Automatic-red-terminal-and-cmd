How to use:
Start cmd.reg (changes cmd color to red (aka color 4))
Important : you need to put the WindowsPowershell folder in documents.
also before  running powershell.reg you need to write this in admin terminal (powershell):
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
and you need to type "A" to confirm the changes inm terminal.
IMPORTANT!:
This is only work for that cmd's you open.
If a file opens a cmd it won't work (this code).
